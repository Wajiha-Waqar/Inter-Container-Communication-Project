# 🐳 Virtual System & Services — Inter-Container Communication Project

This project demonstrates how multiple **containers** can be deployed and configured to **communicate with each other** in a virtualized environment using containerization technology.  
The goal is to understand **virtual systems, services deployment, container networking, and service communication**.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to:

> Design and implement a virtual system where multiple services run in **separate containers** and **communicate with each other** over a virtual network.

This project reflects real-world microservices architecture and cloud-based system design.

---

## 🧱 System Architecture

The system consists of multiple containers:

- **Client Container** – Sends requests  
- **Service Container** – Processes requests  
- **Database Container** – Stores data  
- **Network Layer** – Virtual bridge network enabling communication  

All containers run independently but operate as **one integrated system**.
